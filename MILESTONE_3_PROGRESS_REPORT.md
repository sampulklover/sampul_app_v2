Security Audits and Penetration Testing
Implementation Status: Complete
Security has been a fundamental consideration throughout the development process, with multiple layers of security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure application integrity. The security architecture follows defense-in-depth principles, implementing security controls at multiple levels to ensure comprehensive protection.
The application implements secure authentication through Supabase Auth, which provides industry-standard security features including secure password hashing using bcrypt, secure session management with JWT tokens, and protection against common authentication attacks. All API communications are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS, ensuring that data in transit is protected from interception. Sensitive data such as payment information is handled exclusively through secure third-party services (Stripe) that maintain PCI-DSS compliance, ensuring that payment data never touches the application's infrastructure.
The database schema includes comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies that enforce data access restrictions at the database level, ensuring that users can only access their own data. These policies are enforced by Supabase's PostgreSQL engine, meaning that even if application-level security is compromised, user data remains protected. The RLS policies are configured for all sensitive tables including wills, assets, family members, executor records, trust information, and verification records.
Storage buckets implement Row Level Security policies with different security models based on the sensitivity of the stored content. Some buckets employ a performance-optimized security model where public read access is allowed for efficient file delivery, while all write operations (upload, update, delete) are strictly restricted to authenticated users only. Additionally, file paths are structured using user-specific identifiers and timestamps, making them effectively unguessable and providing security through obscurity. This approach balances performance with security, as files cannot be discovered or accessed without knowledge of the exact path.
Other storage buckets used for sensitive personal documents, profile pictures, and family member photos implement more restrictive authentication-based access controls, ensuring that sensitive data is protected with stricter access policies. These storage-level security policies work in conjunction with database RLS to provide layered protection of user data across both structured data and file storage, with the security model adapted to the sensitivity of each data type.

The subscription system ensures that payment processing occurs through secure, PCI-compliant channels managed by Stripe, with webhook signature verification to prevent unauthorized subscription modifications.
Security best practices have been followed throughout development, including secure environment variable management, proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information, and secure storage of authentication tokens.
